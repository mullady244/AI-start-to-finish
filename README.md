# 📘 Algebra Map – AI Start to Finish

**Algebra Map** is a conceptual learning tool developed as part of the **AI Start to Finish** initiative. This app helps learners move beyond solving for x and instead focus on understanding how algebra works at a structural level.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This tool is not a solver. It’s a thinking space.

Users engage with algebra through:

- 🔍 **Type Identification** (True/False)  
- 🎯 **Objective Recognition** (Trim invalid instructions)  
- 💡 **Real-Time Feedback** (Corrects misconceptions)  
- 🧠 **Category-Based Learning** (Grouped by purpose)

It serves as an early module in a larger system designed to teach math, machine learning, and AI through *applied interface building*.

---

## 🧱 Key Features

- **Streamlit-based interactive design**
- **Session-aware logic** with feedback that responds to the user’s actions
- **Rotating incorrect objectives** to build sharper discernment
- **Modular code blocks** for fast debugging and agile development
- **Built-in reinforcement of mental structures**, including grouped categories

---

## 🧠 Educational Strategy

This app is designed with *incremental comprehension* in mind. Instead of overwhelming users with advanced math or long explanations, each part:

- Focuses on conceptual clarity  
- Encourages intuitive categorization  
- Offers immediate feedback on both errors and completions  
- Promotes mastery through active participation

## 🔄 Version Control

Development is structured around **incremental test versions** (Test 1 → Test 36+). Each version:

- Adds or improves a single component  
- Avoids regressions by isolating features  
- Is stored locally by version number for auditing and comparison

---

## 📌 Future Modules

- Quadratic Equations  
- Systems of Equations  
- Inequalities  
- Function Families  
- Intro to Machine Learning Concepts  

This project will serve as the early foundation of a complete AI learning map.
